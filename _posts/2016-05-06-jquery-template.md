It had to happen, when someone is involve in a big company, taking a break it becomes complicated; so one leave the blog. I hope that it never happens to you. It's a shit..

Anyway... This time I don't come to talk you about [horror stories of the evil hell]() or something like that. Over the last month I have been working a lot with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and it [weirds things[() *-I'd say more than normal-*, so I found interesting to share with you the next template which I use for my own jQuery plugins. It's nothing to shout about, but if you are looking for some *fast food* this could be perfect.

Plugin creation
In practical terms, we can refer to [jQuery documentation](https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/) in order to know more about jQuery plugins. But if you already know about it, please feel free to give me a suggestion for this template.

Of course, this would be irrelevant if your intention is use directly [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) because it has a `JQuery.widget` function to solve this situation.
